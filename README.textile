h1. FloodMonkey - Supervise your stream

FloodMonkey helps manage subscriptions to the MySpace Flood, their real-time activity stream API.

FloodMonkey is designed for people looking to capture firehose-level (100%) data streams.  We use it to haul in 25GB+ of raw data every day with a single small EC2 instance and room to spare.

* A simple Sinatra frontend to manage and monitor subscriptions
* Even yet still more lightweight scripts to handle publish callbacks as quickly and simply as possible, and stream them directly to disk.
* Simple worker scripts to bundle the data and ship it to S3
* Scripts to deploy, configure and monitor the various moving parts. 

FloodMonkey is *not* designed for anything real-time. The endpoint streams everything to disk for late bulk processing -- we use "wukong":http://github.com/mrflip/wukong and "wuclan.":http://github.com/mrflip/wuclan
