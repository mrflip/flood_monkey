    # pipe is also used to wakeup from IO.select from inside (worker)
    # signal handlers.  However, workers *close* the pipe descriptors in
    # the signal handlers to raise EBADF in IO.select instead of writing
    # like we do in the master.  We cannot easily use the reader set for
    # IO.select because LISTENERS is already that set, and it's extra
    # work (and cycles) to distinguish the pipe FD from the reader set
    # once IO.select returns.  So we're lazy and just close the pipe when
