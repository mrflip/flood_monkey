module Unicorn
  # Writes a Rack response to your client using the HTTP/1.1 specification.
  # You use it by simply doing:
  #
  #   status, headers, body = rack_app.call(env)
  #   HttpResponse.write(socket, [ status, headers, body ])
  #
  # Most header correctness (including Content-Length and Content-Type)
  # is the job of Rack, with the exception of the "Connection: close"
  # and "Date" headers.
  #
  # A design decision was made to force the client to not pipeline or
  # keepalive requests.  HTTP/1.1 pipelining really kills the
  # performance due to how it has to be handled and how unclear the
  # standard is.  To fix this the HttpResponse always gives a
  # "Connection: close" header which forces the client to close right
  # away.  The bonus for this is that it gives a pretty nice speed boost
  # to most clients since they can close their connection immediately.
