I called this cartilage because cute names are important in the ruby world. (see lazybones)

Cartilage = (Monk) skeleton on DataMapper (cartography?) Or something. Gimme a break.

Unlike the main monk skeleton, I didn't commit the contents of the vendor directory.

Instead, after you check out the skeleton, be sure to use the dep tool to build them.

dep vendor --all


Also, open config/settings.yml and change the SQLite3 database name(s) to reflect your set-up or switch to MySQL, Postgres, etc.

TODO, requests for help - stuff I would like to add:

1. A task to do some env/variable injection/interpolation. For example, a tool to inject an app name into the settings.yml file.
2. Support for memcached out of the box to cache the results of DataMapper lookups.
